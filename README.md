# DataGrid.svelte
A basic svelte datagrid component with some advanced features (sort, filter, events)

# Demo
Here is a live demo:
https://bassem-essam.github.io/DataGrid.svelte/

# Features
- Advanced filtering options using javascript code
- Sortable data
- Ability to add event handlers (on:rowClick, on:rowDoubleClick, on:cellClick, on:headCellClick)

# Usage
1. clone this repository
2. copy the entire datagrid folder into your svelte project under /lib directory probably
3. import DataGrid component and use it directly

# Learning Outcomes
1. How to make a minimal event system
2. svelte/store is the best

# TODOs
- Add typescript (or at least make events
- Refactor the code

# Advice
Use TanStack or something similar to build your datagrid component as I guess it may offer customizability and good features out of the box. 

# License
This code is your responsibility now
